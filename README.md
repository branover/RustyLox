# RustyLox
A Rust implementation of the Crafting Interpreters language, Lox.

Currently a work in progress.  I'm working through Part 1 right now by take the Java interpreter or Lox in the book
and implementing it in Rust.

# Running
To use with a .lox script, run:
```
cargo run [script]
```

To use as a REPL command line, run it by itself:
```
cargo run
```
