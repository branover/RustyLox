# RustyLox
A Rust implementation of the Crafting Interpreters language, Lox.

Currently fully implements all features in the Java interpreter part of the book.  

Has not been thoroughly tested, optimized, or commented.  Sorry.  I may come back and figure out how to optimize it later.

# Running
To use with a .lox script, run:
```
cargo run [script]
```

To use as a REPL command line, run it by itself:
```
cargo run
```
